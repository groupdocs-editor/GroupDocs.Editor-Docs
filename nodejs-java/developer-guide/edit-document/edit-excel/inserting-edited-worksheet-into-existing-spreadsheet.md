## Overview

Starting from version 24.6, GroupDocs.Editor for Node.js introduces the ability to insert an edited worksheet into an existing spreadsheet, changing the default behavior of overwriting the entire workbook with a new single worksheet. This feature provides more flexibility in managing Excel spreadsheets when editing individual worksheets.

### Default Editing Pipeline

the typical workflow for editing a spreadsheet was:

1. Load the spreadsheet into the `Editor` class using a file or stream.
2. Specify the worksheet to edit by setting its index in the `SpreadsheetEditOptions`.
3. Use the `Editor.edit()` method to get the `EditableDocument` containing the HTML and CSS representation of the selected worksheet.
4. Send the HTML/CSS content to a client-side WYSIWYG editor.
5. Once editing is complete, retrieve the modified HTML/CSS content from the client-side and pass it back to the server.
6. Create an instance of `EditableDocument` with the modified content.
7. Use `SpreadsheetSaveOptions` to configure how the spreadsheet should be saved.
8. Call `Editor.save()` to save the changes, creating a new spreadsheet that contains the edited worksheet only.

### New Feature: Inserting Edited Worksheet

This process can be enhanced by inserting the edited worksheet into the original spreadsheet instead of generating a new one with only the edited worksheet. 

The `SpreadsheetSaveOptions` class has two new properties:

- `worksheetNumber`: This defines the position where the edited worksheet should be inserted.
- `insertAsNewWorksheet`: A boolean flag that determines whether to replace an existing worksheet or insert the edited worksheet as a new one.

```javascript
let worksheetNumber = 1; // Set worksheet number
let insertAsNewWorksheet = true; // Insert the edited worksheet as a new one
```

If `worksheetNumber` is `0`, a new single-worksheet spreadsheet will be created. However, if a valid spreadsheet is loaded and `worksheetNumber` is greater than `0`, the edited worksheet will be inserted into the existing spreadsheet.

## WorksheetNumber Property

The `worksheetNumber` property determines where in the spreadsheet the new worksheet will be inserted. Worksheet numbering starts at `1`, similar to how Excel numbers worksheets, not the zero-based index typically used in programming.

If the number exceeds the number of worksheets in the spreadsheet, it will be adjusted to the last worksheet.

```javascript
let saveOptions = new SpreadsheetSaveOptions();
saveOptions.worksheetNumber = 2; // Insert into second worksheet
```

Additionally, negative numbers can be used to count from the end of the spreadsheet, where `-1` is the last worksheet, `-2` is the second to last, and so on. 

Example with positive and negative numbering:

```javascript
saveOptions.worksheetNumber = -1; // Insert as last worksheet
saveOptions.worksheetNumber = 5;  // Insert into fifth worksheet (or adjust if fewer exist)
```

## InsertAsNewWorksheet Property

The `insertAsNewWorksheet` property determines whether to replace the worksheet at the specified position or insert a new one.

- If `insertAsNewWorksheet` is `false`, the worksheet at the specified position is replaced by the edited one.
- If `insertAsNewWorksheet` is `true`, the edited worksheet is inserted, and existing worksheets are shifted accordingly.

```javascript
saveOptions.insertAsNewWorksheet = true;  // Enable inserting the edited worksheet as new
```

For example, inserting a worksheet in various positions:

```javascript
saveOptions.worksheetNumber = 3;  // Insert at the third worksheet
saveOptions.insertAsNewWorksheet = true;  // Keep existing worksheets and insert new one
```

### Example Code for Node.js

```javascript
const groupdocs = require('groupdocs-editor');
const Editor = groupdocs.Editor;
const SpreadsheetSaveOptions = groupdocs.options.SpreadsheetSaveOptions;
const SpreadsheetEditOptions = groupdocs.options.SpreadsheetEditOptions;

// Load the existing spreadsheet into the Editor
const editor = new Editor('Sample.xlsx');

// Prepare options for editing the spreadsheet
const editOptions = new SpreadsheetEditOptions();
editOptions.worksheetIndex = 1;  // Edit the second worksheet (0-based index)

// Get the editable document (HTML/CSS)
const editableDocument = editor.edit(editOptions);

// Simulate editing the document and retrieving it back as HTML
const editedContent = '<html>...edited content...</html>';
const resources = [];

// Create a new EditableDocument instance with the edited content
const updatedDocument = EditableDocument.fromMarkup(editedContent, resources);

// Prepare save options
const saveOptions = new SpreadsheetSaveOptions();
saveOptions.worksheetNumber = 2;  // Insert as second worksheet
saveOptions.insertAsNewWorksheet = true;  // Insert as new worksheet

// Save the updated spreadsheet
editor.save(updatedDocument, 'UpdatedSample.xlsx', saveOptions);
```

## Additional Notes

This new feature doesn't modify the original spreadsheet loaded into the `Editor` class. When the edited worksheet is inserted into the spreadsheet, the original document is copied, and the worksheet is added to the copy. Thus, the original spreadsheet remains unchanged.

Itâ€™s also important to note that inserting an edited worksheet requires that the loaded document is a valid spreadsheet. The `worksheetNumber` and `insertAsNewWorksheet` properties must be properly configured for the feature to work as expected.
