## New features and improvements

### Ability to generate a preview of selected worksheet of a loaded spreadsheet in SVG format

Starting from the version 23.4 the GroupDocs.Editor for .NET is able to generate an SVG preview of arbitrary worksheet within spreadsheet. In order to do this need to load a desired spreadsheet document inside the [`Editor`](https://reference.groupdocs.com/editor/net/groupdocs.editor/editor/) class, invoke the [`GetDocumentInfo`](https://reference.groupdocs.com/editor/net/groupdocs.editor/editor/getdocumentinfo/) method, and then in the obtained [`GroupDocs.Editor.Metadata.SpreadsheetDocumentInfo`](https://reference.groupdocs.com/editor/net/groupdocs.editor.metadata/spreadsheetdocumentinfo/) struct call the [`GeneratePreview(int worksheetIndex)`](https://reference.groupdocs.com/editor/net/groupdocs.editor.metadata/spreadsheetdocumentinfo/generatepreview/) method.

A separate article ["Generating worksheets (tabs) preview for spreadsheet"](https://docs.groupdocs.com/editor/net/generating-worksheets-preview-for-spreadsheet) explains this new feature in detail.

### New e-Book save options

In previous versions there were two different classes for save options for the e-Book formats family: `EpubSaveOptions` and `Azw3SaveOptions`. In version 23.4 these classes are deleted and replaced with single common `EbookSaveOptions` class. Article ["How to edit e-Book file"](https://docs.groupdocs.com/editor/net/how-to-edit-ebook/) explains this change in detail.

### Support of export into Mobi format

Before the version 23.4 was released, the Mobi format was supported only on import, so it was possible to load and edit a Mobi document, but not to save the edited document in Mobi format. Starting from the version 23.4 this is possible. Article ["How to edit Mobi file "](https://docs.groupdocs.com/editor/net/how-to-edit-mobi-file/) explains this in detail.

### Greatly improved HTML parser

In the version 23.4 the HTML parser was significantly improved. Now it is able to correctly process invalid, incorrect and distorted markup. In particular, the next distortions are supported:
- Flow elements nested inside phrasing elements, for example, `P` inside `P` or `DIV` inside `SPAN`.
- Prohibited elements and nodes inside TABLE element, for example, prohibited `P` inside `TABLE` or `DIV` inside `TR` will be pushed upward.
- `SELECT` is generated and applied as a parent for the orphan `OPTION`/`OPTGROUP` elements, because `OPTION`/`OPTGROUP` must be direct children of the `SELECT`.
- `COLGROUP` is generated and applied as a parent for the `COL`.
- Incorrectly nested lists are properly processed.
- Better parsing of HTML attributes
- And many more

### New method for obtaining an HTML markup

Now the [`EditableDocument`](https://reference.groupdocs.com/editor/net/groupdocs.editor/editabledocument/) class contains a new public method [`EditableDocument.GetContent`](https://reference.groupdocs.com/editor/net/groupdocs.editor/editabledocument/getcontent/#getcontent_2), which allows to obtains the HTML markup of the opened document and write it to the specified stream with specified text encoding.
