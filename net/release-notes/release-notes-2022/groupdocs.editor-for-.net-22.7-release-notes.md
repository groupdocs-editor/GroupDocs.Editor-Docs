GroupDocs.Editor for .NET version 22.7 is a new groundbraking release that contains tons of a brand new feature, included a super feature we've been working during past years — an ability to edit PDF documents like an ordinary text! Along with PDF support, this version also fully support editing of the documents within Email format family like EML, MSG and others. Number of improvements and bug fixes is countless. 

So jump in and read the detailed summary about what was done during all this time when GroupDocs.Editor for .NET was in the shadow.

## New features and improvements

### PDF support

Now GroupDocs.Editor for .NET supports a complete pipeline for the PDF documents, including loading, editing, saving, and extracting document metainfo. Password-protected PDFs are supported on input and output. Here is a [special article for PDF](https://docs.groupdocs.com/editor/net/edit-pdf/).

### XPS support

Like the PDF, GroupDocs.Editor for .NET now fully supports the XPS format too. It has no loading options, but all other is similar to the PDF.

### Email support

Another groundbraking feature — full support of different Email formats, including (but not limited to) EML, EMLX, MSG, PST, MBOX and others. [Special article for Email](https://docs.groupdocs.com/editor/net/edit-email/).

### AZW3 support

Along with previously supported Mobi, now GroupDocs.Editor for .NET supports an AZW3 format, which may be considered as an advanced successor for the Mobi. Like the Mobi, for now AZW3 is accessible only for import, but not for export.

### Support of new HTML elements

In the version 22.7 we've added support of a many new HTML-elements, including those, which are generated by MS Office when saving documents to the HTML format.

### New format detector

New GroupDocs.Editor for .NET version 22.7 contains a fully reworked and dramatically improved document format detector. Now automatic detection mechanism is much more robust and accurate.

## Runtime version information

GroupDocs.Editor for .NET version 22.7 is the latest product, which is released for the platforms/runtimes .NET Framework 2.0, .NET Framework 4.6.1 and .NET Standard 2.0.

{{< alert style="info" >}}In the next releases the support of .NET Framework 2.0 will be dropped.{{< /alert >}}
